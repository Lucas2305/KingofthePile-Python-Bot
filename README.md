# KingofthePile-Python-Bot
This is a python bot for the game King of the Pile. 

It takes the nugget from the server and types it into the command line.
This is version 1.2 which needs some work done.

The ip address has to be added and delays have to be changed.
!! install the following !!
-pynput
-bs4
-requests
-BeatifulSoup

The program could be to fast for the server so change the delay.
